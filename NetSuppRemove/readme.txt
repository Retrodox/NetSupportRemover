Notes: Jared Mingle is the POC for this if you want to help make suggestions or additions to this. BTW no need to regbang before using this remove tool
*** AND NO LONGER ANY NEED TO COPY TO C:\ ****

Steps:
1. Run remove.bat as administrator
2. Follows prompts

***IMPORTANT***
If at the end, my program fails to uninstall, verify for sure that it didn't uninstall by running remove.bat again and let jared mingle know what processes were preventing it from closing.
If the processes that are preventing it from uninstalling are related to windows processes then I can't add those to the kill tasks list since if they are closed
windows will crash or have to reboot. If this happens the only way I've found to fix it is to wait for a bit since my program ended almost everything associated
with netsupport it takes a bit for the files to stop being in use with windows processes. After you wait a bit try running "TryThisIfAllElseFails.ps1". If that
doesn't work then reboot and delete the netsupport folder and uninstall netsupport in programs and features. Reboot and it should let you uninstall.

Side note: Don't close TryThisIfAllElseFails.ps1 until it finishes
